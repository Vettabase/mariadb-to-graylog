# TODO

If we have evidence that the project is used, we plan to maintain it and add features when/if they are needed.
This is just a list of features that are needed to complete the initial project.


## Mandatory

* Add support for the Slow Log
* Anonymise queries (probably using pt-fingerprint)


## Nice to have

* Split long UDP messages so that it's not necessary to fallback to TCP
